microG GmsCore is a FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) framework to allow applications designed for Google Play Services to run on systems, where Play Services is not available.

This fork tweaks MicroG to be usable by applications that require Google authentication such as [YouTube Vanced+](https://github.com/cuynu/ytvancedx) or [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced), [ReVanced Extended](https://github.com/inotia00) / [ReX](https://github.com/YT-Advanced).
